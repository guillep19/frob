The Lisp version of IPC has currently been tested only under Linux and only
with Allegro Common Lisp.

To make IPC for Lisp on your system, you will need SWIG (currently
tested using version 2.0.8).  With SWIG installed, you just type
"gmake install" and everything should happen automatically.  After
completing, you should have IPC.lisp in this directory and
libipc_lisp.so in the ../lib/<sys> directory (where <sys> is Linux-2.6,
for instance).
