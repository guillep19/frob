		Installation instructions for IPC (LISP users)

1) Install the C version of IPC (see ../src/INSTALL)

2) Do "gmake install" in this directory (you must have SWIG installed)

3) To compile the files (optional), run Lisp and do (compile-file <x>) 
   where <x> is each of primFmttrs, formatters, and ipcLisp

To load and run the LISP version of IPC, do (load "IPC").
  This will load all the relevant IPC LISP files, including the C
  libraries needed to run IPC.

See the README file for instructions on how to make programs that use the IPC.
